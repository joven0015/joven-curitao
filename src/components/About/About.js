      <p>Hello! I'm Joven. I love building things online and growing with every experience and project. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering but chose to pursue my passion for becoming a professional software engineer. Right now, I'm actively deepening my expertise in web development and creating projects including this portfolio.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      I love discovering smarter ways to build seamless user experiences through clean, efficient, and scalable code. I see work as a continuous learning experience and value opportunities to collaborate with those who are as generous with their knowledge as I am eager to learn. Ultimately, my goal is to build beautiful, meaningful things with people who inspire me to do my best work.
      <br/>
      <br/>
       I’m excited to connect, collaborate, and continue growing in this ever-evolving field. If you’d like to work together or just say hi, feel free to reach out!
